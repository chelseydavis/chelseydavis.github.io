<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a digital marketer, living in Denver, Colorado. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because as a digital marketer, my industry is ever-evolving and I would like to add these essential skills to my growing knowledgebase.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>

<p> As I learn about front-end, I hope to one day work as a digital marketing strategist with the ability to do things on my own instead of relying on others to perform the tasks I will be learning in this class. At this point in my career, I'm not sure what my ideal company to work for woud be, but it will definitely need to be a company that is open to try new things and be a pioneer in its industry.</p>
