     <H2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</H2>

     <p>The two websites I chose were <a href="https://thecleansekitchen.com.au/">Cleanse Kitchen</a> and <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>.</p>

     <h2>How do they Exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

     <h3>Cleanse Kitchen</h3>
     <p> I love this site because it grabs your attention right from the start. I would say the focal point is the actual video on the homepage, partnered with the "play intro video" button.</p>

     <p><strong>Space:</strong> While there is a video and a large image on each section, there is plenty of space throughout the entire site. You could say the images are the "white space" for each block, which helps to draw your eye to the center of each section.</p>
     <p><strong>Size:</strong> There are larger images throughout the entire site, especially the homepage, but they help to make the copy stand out and also help to break up each section.</p>
     <p><strong>Balance:</strong> The larger images really help to create a nice balance, acting as the "white space" of the site, but also helping to create a visual flow for visitors. The video on the homepage helps to make the navigation pop, and the square images for products on the "Our Cleanses" page really helps to bring the copy to life.</p>
     <p> Overall, I think the site is very effective in terms of guiding the user through the site, but might need more consistency with font type and color, so as not to be too distracting. It also could use a different focal point and not the "start the intro video" button, but more of a call to action about the products.<br></br>

     <h3>HubSpot</h3>
     <p>This website does a really good job of driving your attention to the headline "Grow Your Business", obviously attracting the right types of visitors from teh get go.</p>

     <p><strong>Space:</strong> This design provides tons of space, which really allows you to focus on the copy in the center of the site. I would say, however, the top navigation is not as noticeable as maybe it should be. 
     <p><strong>Size:</strong> Like the Cleanse Kitchen website, HubSpot uses bigger sections of images to break up the different areas. These images are larger than other areas of the site, but help to guide the user down the rest of the site, allowing them to focus on the copy.</p>
     <p><strong>Balance:</strong> Great balance of copy, imagery and white space.</p>
     <p>HubSpot does a really great job of driving visitors down their page. They use connectors between the sections and have a pattern that consists of lots of white space followed by a large image.</p>

     <h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

     <p> HubSpot does a way better job of directing the flow down the site and directly points out what you're at the site for (growing your business). Cleanse Kitchen grabs your attention right away, but might miss the initial opportunity to get visitors into the sales funnel.</p>
