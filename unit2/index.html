     <H2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</H2>

     <p>The two websites I chose were <a href="https://thecleansekitchen.com.au/">Cleanse Kitchen</a> and <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>.</p>

     <h2>How do they Exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

     <h3>Cleanse Kitchen</h3>
     <p> I love this site because it grabs your attention right from the start. I would say the focal point is the actual video on the homepage, partnered with the "play intro video" button.</p>

     <p><strong>Space:</strong> While there is a video and a large image on each section, there is plenty of space throughout the entire site. You could say the images are the "white space" for each block, which helps to draw your eye to the center of each section.</p>
     <p><strong>Size:</strong> There are larger images throughout the entire site, especially the homepage, but they help to make the copy stand out and also help to break up each section.</p>
     <p><strong>Balance:</strong> The larger images really help to create a nice balance, acting as the "white space" of the site, but also helping to create a visual flow for visitors. The video on the homepage helps to make the navigation pop, and the square images for products on the "Our Cleanses" page really helps to bring the copy to life.</p>
     <p> Overall, I think the site is very effective in terms of guiding the user through the site, but might need more consistency with font type and color, so as not to be too distracting. It also could use a different focal point and not the "start the intro video" button, but more of a call to action about the products.<br></br>

     <h3>HubSpot</h3>
     <p>This website does a really good job of driving your attention to the headline "Grow Your Business", obviously attracting the right types of visitors from the get go.</p>

     <p><strong>Space:</strong> This design provides tons of space, which really allows you to focus on the copy in the center of the site. I would say, however, the top navigation is not as noticeable as maybe it should be. 
     <p><strong>Size:</strong> Like the Cleanse Kitchen website, HubSpot uses bigger sections of images to break up the different areas. These images are larger than other areas of the site, but help to guide the user down the rest of the site, allowing them to focus on the copy.</p>
     <p><strong>Balance:</strong> Great balance of copy, imagery and white space.</p>
     <p>HubSpot does a really great job of driving visitors down their page. They use connectors between the sections and have a pattern that consists of lots of white space followed by a large image.</p>

     <h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

     <p> HubSpot does a way better job of directing the flow down the site and directly points out what you're at the site for (growing your business). Cleanse Kitchen grabs your attention right away, but might miss the initial opportunity to get visitors into the sales funnel.</p>

     <h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

      <ul>
  <li><strong>Homepage Sketch 1</strong></li>
  <img src="Homepage_1.png" alt="Homepage 1" height="300" width="300">
  <br></br>
  <li><STRONG>Homepage Sketch 2</STRONG></li>
  <img src="Homepage_2.png" alt="Homepage 2" height="300" width="300">
  </ul>
  <p>The first sketch is a homepage for, say a blog, and the focal point is the large dark blue square at the top. This would be used to showcase some sort of call to action, something the blog immediately wants their visitors to do. The smaller blue squares will be images of the most recent blog posts, with the turquoise sections above representing the audience segments and the ones below as a date/article preview. This helps to balance images with copy. The second sketch is more like the first website in my analysis, with a large image and a small icon to the right that grabs the attention (a call to action). The user is then directed by the small blue ball to keep scrolling.</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Homepage 1 Hover</strong></li>
  <img src="Homepage_Hover.png" alt="Homepage Hover" height="300" width="300">
  <br></br>
  <li><strong>Scrolling Homepage 2</strong></li>
  <img src="ScrollingHomepage_2.png" alt="HScrolling Homepage 2" height="300" width="300">
  </ul>
  <p>The first sketch uses a hover effect to give you different menu options for that particular category on the blog. The 3 smaller squares are the most recent blog post images and the longer rectangle and bigger square to the right is a search function and an archive type of search. The entire purple section is what happens when you hover your mouse over "Target Audience 1". The purple rectangle is used as navigation and the different color allows it to become the focal point. The second sketch is the continuously scrolling home page. The two turqouise rectangles represent a break in the scrolling and the circles become the focal point as they are the only item in the area of white space. These circles will be further navigation items.
